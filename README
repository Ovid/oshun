Data::Checks version 0.002

    This is NOT a type system for Perl.

    The fundamental problem with type systems is that every individual programmer
    knows exactly what they mean by – and want in – and need from – a “type system”
    ...but no two programmers can ever agree precisely what that is.

    What most Perl users actually need is a practical way to ensure that, when a value
    that is assigned to a variable, or passed to a parameter, or returned from a
    subroutine, that value conforms to the designer’s original expectations and
    assumptions (e.g. did their subroutine get passed a positive integer and a
    filehandle, and did it return a reference to a hash of strings?)

    So this is not a compile-time type-system for Perl.
    It’s a runtime data-checking system for Perl: a system of “checks”.

    A check is an assertion about the value(s) that can be assigned to a variable,
    passed to a parameter, or returned by a subroutine. This module provides
    a large number of built-in checks and will eventually offer a mechanism
    for specifying user-defined checks as well.
